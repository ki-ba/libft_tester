## Sloppy Libft Tester

A quick-and-dirty tester for 42 school's project Libft.
I use it for quick evaluations; do not use it to test your libft before submitting, as it is really not that good.

### Installation

Clone it in the same directory as your libft/ folder, then run `make run`.

It absolutely might not work. Also, you might want to manually test some of the bonus functions.
