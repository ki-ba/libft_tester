## Sloppy Libft Tester

A quick-and-dirty tester for 42 school's project Libft.
I use it for quick evaluations; do not use it to test your libft before submitting, as it is really not that good.

### Installation

Clone it in the same directory as your libft/ folder, then run `make`.

It absolutely might not work. I didn't test it much.
Also, It doesn't test all libft functions. You especially might want to manually test the bonus functions.

Built with (Unity)[https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity].
